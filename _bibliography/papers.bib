  title     = "SMS reminders to improve the uptake and timeliness of the primary immunisation series in infants: a multi-centre randomised controlled trial",
  abstract  = "Background: Immunisation timeliness continues to present challenges to achieving optimal vaccine coverage in infancy, particularly in disadvantaged groups and Australian First Nations infants. We aimed to determine whether a tailored, educational SMS reminder improves the timeliness of immunisation in infants up to seven months of age. Methods: A pragmatic, three-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of immunisation reminders was conducted in two First-Nations-specific primary health care centres and two public hospital antenatal clinics in South East Queensland, Australia. Live-born infants of mothers enrolled during pregnancy were randomised at birth and followed to eight months of age. One group received a simple SMS reminder at two weeks before, the week of, and two weeks after the due date for immunisation at two, four and six months of age. The second group received a tailored SMS with an educational message at two weeks before and on the date immunisations were due; those not immunised two weeks following the due date were offered support to immunise the baby. Controls received no intervention or contact until the baby turned seven months of age. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants age-appropriately vaccinated at seven months of age as recorded on the Australian Immunisation Register. Secondary outcomes included vaccination status at three and five months of age. Results: Between 30 May 2016 and 24 May 2018, one hundred and ninety-six infants (31% First Nations infants) were randomised. At seven months of age, 54/65 (83.1%) infants in the educational SMS ± additional support group (ESMS±S) were age-appropriately immunised, compared to 45/64 (70.3%) in the simple SMS group and 45/67 (67.2%) in controls. Differences were most marked at five months of age: ESMS±S 95.5%; simple SMS 73.4%; controls 75.8%. The difference between the ESMS±S group and the other two groups at seven months of age was no longer apparent when those who received additional support beyond the SMS were assumed to have not been vaccinated if that support had not been received. Discussion: A tailored SMS reminder system using an educational message and with provision of additional support to mothers is more effective in improving immunisation timeliness in infants at three and five months of age than a simple message and no intervention. The additional support was required at seven months of age in order to achieve higher coverage in the ESMS±S group.",

  title     = "Utility of a personalised B ronchiectasis A ction M anagement P lan (BAMP) for children with bronchiectasis: Protocol for a multicentre, double-blind parallel, superiority randomised controlled trial",
  abstract  = "Introduction: Bronchiectasis is no longer considered rare or irreversible in children, yet it remains relatively under-researched and neglected in respiratory health globally. Bronchiectasis (including chronic suppurative lung disease) causes substantial morbidity for patients and significant impact on caregivers, especially during acute respiratory exacerbations. In other chronic respiratory diseases (eg, asthma), empowering consumers with an individualised plan for management of acute exacerbations improves clinical outcomes. However, in the absence of any such data specific to bronchiectasis, action management plans are rarely currently used in children or adults with bronchiectasis. We hypothesise that providing an individualised bronchiectasis action management plan (BAMP) to children with bronchiectasis reduces non-scheduled doctor consultations, compared with not having a BAMP. Methods and analysis: This multicentre, parallel, double-blind, randomised trial involving three urban Australian hospitals commenced in June 2018 and will include 198 children, aged <19 years with bronchiectasis who had 2 or more exacerbations in the previous 18 months. Children will be randomised to having an individualised BAMP or standard care (a decoy clinic letter). Primary caregivers will then be followed up monthly for 12 months. The primary outcome is the rate of acute non-scheduled doctor visits for respiratory exacerbations by 12 months. The main secondary outcomes are cough-specific quality of life scores at 6 and 12 months, overall exacerbation rate over 12 months, and proportion of children who received timely influenza vaccination by 30 May annually. Ethics and dissemination: The Human Research Ethics Committees of the Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Heath Research and Queensland Children's Hospital approved the study. The results of the trial will be submitted for publication and the BAMP made available free online. Trial registration number: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ACTRN12618000604202.
